# MERN

This is a MERN project which includes React, Node, Express and MongoDB. On the front end side, this project is built using React, react-redux, bootstrap and css framework, that can help with building react components. On the back end side, using Node.js as a platform, express as a web framework and MongoDB as a NoSQL database. Using JWT authentication for user info, if the user is logged in then it returns a token and the client saves that token. The client uses that token each time when he tries to access the protected route. 

Designed and developed responsive modules using HTML5 for creating the templates, CSS3 to style the application, with JavaScript, Bootstrap4, ReactJS, NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB. Built out a component-based architecture using ReactJS and Redux. Worked on React JS Virtual DOM and React views, rendering using components which contains custom HTML directives in JSX. Used react-router-dom for rendering to configured components such as login and logout.
Maintained states in the stores and dispatched the actions using redux. Created controller view that interacts with store and holds data in state. Added dynamic functionality by creating and dispatching Action Creators that deployed Actions. Used Middleware, Redux-thunk and react-redux in application to asynchronously fetch and send data from server-side to produce and consume RESTful web services. Created NodeJS server-side for creating RESTful Web Services using Express and Mongoose to connect with MongoDB and authenticated the user information using JWT. 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

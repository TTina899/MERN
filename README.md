# MERN

This is a MERN project which includes React Redux Node MongoDB JWT Authentication. On the front end side, this project is built using React, react-redux, bootstrap and css framework,  that can help with building react components. On the back end side, using Node.js as a platform, express as a web framework and MongoDB as a NoSQL database. Using JWT authentication for user info, if the user is logged in then it returns a token and the client saves that token. The client uses that token each time when he tries to access the protected route.
